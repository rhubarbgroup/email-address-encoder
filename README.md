# Email Address Encoder for WordPress

A lightweight plugin that protects plain email addresses and mailto links from email-harvesting robots by encoding them into decimal and hexadecimal entities. Has effect on the posts, pages, comments, excerpts, text widgets and other filtered content. Works without JavaScript â€” just simple spam protection.

To see whether all your email addresses are properly protected, use the free [page scanner](https://encoder.till.im/scanner?utm_source=wp-plugin&amp;utm_medium=readme) tool.

Other content (like phone numbers) can be protected using `[encode]` shortcode:

```
[encode]+1 (555) 123-4567[/encode]
[encode link="tel:+15551234567"]+1 (555) 123-4567[/encode]
```

**Premium Features**

* **Full-page protection** that catches all email addresses
* **Hardened protection** using JavaScript and CSS techniques
* Built-in plugin support for **ACF**, **WooCommerce** and many others
