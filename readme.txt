A lightweight plugin that protects email addresses from email-harvesting robots, by encoding them into decimal and hexadecimal entities.


== Description ==

A lightweight plugin that protects plain email addresses and mailto links from email-harvesting robots, by encoding them into decimal and hexadecimal entities. Has an effect on the posts, pages, comments, excerpts, text widgets and other filtered content. Works without JavaScript — just simple spam protection.

To see whether all your email addresses are properly protected, use the free [page scanner](https://encoder.till.im/scanner?utm_source=wp-plugin&amp;utm_medium=readme) tool.

Other content (like phone numbers) can be protected using `[encode]` shortcode:

`
[encode]+1 (555) 123-4567[/encode]
[encode link="tel:+15551234567"]+1 (555) 123-4567[/encode]
`

= Premium Features =

* **Full-page protection** that catches all email addresses
* **Hardened protection** using JavaScript and CSS techniques
* Improved **phone number** protection
* Built-in plugin support for **ACF**, **Jetpack**, **WooCommerce** and many others

== Installation ==

For detailed installation instructions, please read the [standard installation procedure for WordPress plugins](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins).

1. Upload the `/email-address-encoder/` directory and its contents to `/wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Login to your WordPress installation and activate the plugin through the _Plugins_ menu.
3. Use the "Page Scanner" under _Settings -> Email Encoder_ to test if your email addresses are protected.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin do? =

This plugin searches for email addresses using WordPress filters like `the_content`, `widget_text` and others. Found email addresses are encoded using decimal and hexadecimal HTML entities, which obfuscates the email addresses to protect it from being read by most email-harvesting robots.

Alternatively, you can use the `[encode]` shortcode: `[encode]+1 (555) 123-4567[/encode]`

= How can I make sure the plugin works? =

You can use the "Page Scanner" found under _Settings -> Email Encoder_ to see whether all your email addresses are protected. Alternatively, you can manually look at the "page source" of your site.

**Please note:** Chrome’s Developer Tools, Safari’s Web Inspector and others automatically decode decimal and hexadecimal entities. You need to look at the "plain HTML source code".

= How can I filter other parts of my site? =

[This guide](https://encoder.till.im/guide?utm_source=wp-plugin&amp;utm_medium=readme) will help you encode all email addresses that aren’t caught.
